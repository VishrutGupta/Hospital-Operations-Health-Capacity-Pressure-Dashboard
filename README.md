# Hospital-Operations-Health-Capacity-Pressure-Dashboard
🔍 Problem Statement

Hospitals face persistent operational stress due to high emergency demand, ICU saturation, and inefficient patient flow. Leadership teams often lack a single, clear view that connects admissions, bed occupancy, ICU pressure, and staffing risk—making proactive decision-making difficult.

This project addresses that gap by providing an executive-level operational health dashboard that highlights where pressure originates and where immediate action is required.

🎯 Objective

To help hospital administrators:

Assess overall hospital health at a glance

Identify drivers of operational pressure

Pinpoint departments requiring immediate intervention

Support data-driven capacity and staffing decisions

📊 What I Built

An interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes hospital operational health across three dimensions:

1. Hospital Health Overview

Key KPIs:

Total Admissions

Average Length of Stay (ALOS)

Bed Occupancy %

ICU Occupancy %

Conditional coloring highlights risk levels:

🟥 Action Now

🟧 Monitor

🟩 Buffer

2. Pressure Drivers

Monthly trend of Emergency vs Scheduled admissions

Department-wise Emergency admission share

Insight text explaining whether pressure is structural or seasonal

3. Where Admins Should Act

Bed Occupancy Rate by Department

Doctor Utilization Risk by Department

Clear, actionable recommendations based on risk levels

🧠 Key Insights

Emergency demand remains consistently high, not seasonal

ICU occupancy exceeds safe operating thresholds

Emergency and Cardiology are in high-risk zones

Pediatrics and Orthopedics act as short-term buffers

Capacity stress is structural, not episodic

✅ Business Impact

This dashboard enables:

Faster executive decision-making

Targeted staffing and discharge planning

Early detection of systemic capacity stress

Clear communication between clinical and operations teams
